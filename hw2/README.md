# CSCI 5229 Computer Graphics - Homework 2

- **Student:** Sanjay Baskaran  
- **Assignment:** A 3D OpenGL Scene – My Everyday Desk  
- **Time to Complete:** ~20 hours

---

## Program Description

For this assignment, I initially debated various scene ideas before settling on something simple and meaningful — my daily workspace. The scene recreates a familiar environment that I see every day: my desk setup with a monitor, keyboard, mouse, MacBook, notebooks, and floor. It’s a slice of my real life brought into a 3D OpenGL world.

## Features

- **3D Desk Scene:**  
    A fully rendered scene containing:
    - A central desk object
    - A monitor and MacBook
    - A keyboard and mouse resting on a mousepad
    - Multiple notebooks scattered around the desk
    - A Basic floor

- **Multiple Projection Modes:**  
    Toggle between:
    - Overhead Orthographic
    - Overhead Perspective
    - First Person Camera (WASD navigation and mouse-look via arrow keys)

- **Intuitive Controls:**  
    Users can switch views, move around in first-person mode, or rotate the scene freely.
